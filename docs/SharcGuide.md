# SHaRC Overview
Spatial Hash Radiance Cache (SHaRC) is a technique aimed at improving signal quality and performance in the context of path tracing. The SHaRC operates in world space and provides a radiance value at any hit point.
 
## Distribution
SHaRC is distributed as a set of shader-only sources; the package is located in [sdk-libraries/sharc][SharcPackage] and contains shader includes and [integration guide][SharcIntegrationGuide].
